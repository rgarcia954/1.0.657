 @brief This API securely provisions ICV or OEM assets to devices, using CryptoCell.

 It takes an encrypted and authenticated asset package produced by the ICV or OEM asset-packaging offline utility
 (using AES-CCM with key derived from Kpicv or Kcp respectively, and the asset identifier), authenticates and decrypts it.
 The decrypted asset data is returned to the caller.

 @note  The function is valid in all LCSes. However, an error is returned if the requested key is locked.

 @return \c CC_UTIL_OK on success.
 @return A non-zero value on failure, as defined in cc_util_error.h.
