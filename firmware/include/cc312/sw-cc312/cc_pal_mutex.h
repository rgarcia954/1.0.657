 @file
 @brief This file contains functions for resource management (mutex operations).

       These functions are generally implemented as wrappers to different operating-system calls.

       \note None of the described functions validate the input parameters, so that the behavior
       of the APIs in case of an illegal parameter is dependent on the behavior of the operating system.
