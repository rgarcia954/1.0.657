  @brief This function performs all initializations that may be required by your PAL implementation, specifically by the DMA-able buffer
  scheme.

  The existing implementation allocates a contiguous memory pool that is later used by the CryptoCell implementation.
  If no initializations are needed in your environment, the function can be minimized to return OK.
  It is called by ::CC_LibInit.

  @return A non-zero value on failure.
