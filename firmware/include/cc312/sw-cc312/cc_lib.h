 @brief This function performs global initialization of the CryptoCell runtime library.

 It must be called once per CryptoCell cold-boot cycle.
 Among other initializations, this function initializes the CTR-DRBG context
 (including the TRNG seeding). An initialized DRBG context is required for calling
 DRBG APIs, as well as asymmetric-cryptography key-generation and signatures.
 The primary context returned by this function can be used as a single global
 context for all DRBG needs. Alternatively, other contexts may be initialized
 and used with a more limited scope, for specific applications or specific threads.

 @note The Mutexes, if used, are initialized by this API. Therefore, unlike the other
       APIs in the library, this API is not thread-safe.

 @return \c CC_LIB_RET_OK on success.
 @return A non-zero value on failure.
