 @brief The minimal size of the Secure Boot workspace in Bytes.

 The Secure Boot APIs use a temporary workspace for processing the data that is read from the flash,
 before loading the SW modules to their designated memory addresses. This workspace must be large enough to
 accommodate the size of the certificates, and twice the size of the data that is read from flash in each processing round.
 The definition of \c CC_SB_MIN_WORKSPACE_SIZE_IN_BYTES is comprised of \c CC_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES
 and additional space for the certificate itself, which resides in the workspace at the same time the
 SW images data is processed.\n
 It is assumed that the optimal size of the data to read in each processing round is 4KB, based on the standard flash-memory page size.
 Therefore, the size of the double buffer, \c CC_CONFIG_SB_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES, is defined by default as 8KB in the project configuration file.
 This can be changed to accommodate the optimal value in different environments.
 \c CC_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES is defined by the Boot Services makefile as equal to \c CC_CONFIG_SB_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES.

 @note When writing code that uses the Secure Boot APIs, and includes the bootimagesverifier_def.h file,
 the value of \c CC_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES must be defined by your makefile to be exactly the same value as was
 used when compiling the SBROM library, and \c CC_SB_X509_CERT_SUPPORTED must be defined in the Makefile,
 according to the definition of \c CC_CONFIG_SB_X509_CERT_SUPPORTED.\n

 @note The size of \c CC_DOUBLE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE_IN_BYTES must be a multiple of the hash SHA-256 block size of 64 Bytes.
